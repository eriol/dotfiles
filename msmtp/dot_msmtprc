# On Debian apparmor profile for msmtp configuration is:
#  owner @{HOME}/**/.msmtprc        r,
#  owner @{HOME}/**/dot_msmtprc     r,
#  owner @{HOME}/.config/msmtp/*    r,
#  owner @{HOME}/.cache/msmtp/*     r,
# so to keep this file in dotfiles repository one have to choose between
# .msmtprc and dot_msmtprc as file name. dot_msmtprc was choosen to not have
# the file hidden.
